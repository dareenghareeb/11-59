## **Project Overview**

**”11:59”** is a short motion graphic project that explores the concept of overthinking and mental exhaustion that often occurs at night, just before sleep. The project focuses on how simple daily interactions can replay repeatedly in a person’s mind, causing stress and emotional fatigue. Through minimal visuals and abstract motion, the video takes the viewer inside the character’s mind as thoughts overlap, repeat, and intensify. The project is presented as a short animated motion graphic video with a clear emotional message and relatable experience.
